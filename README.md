# Crime_Analysis
Introduction
This project develops a machine learning-based crime prediction system, aiming to predict crime categories and locations using historical data. Several machine learning algorithms were tested, including K-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to evaluate their performance in crime prediction tasks.

Objectives
Develop machine learning models for crime type and location prediction.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in crime data.
Optimize the models using hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
Provide visualizations to help in decision-making for law enforcement.
Methodology
The methodology for this project includes:

Data Collection: Acquire crime datasets from Chicago and Los Angeles.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze crime trends and correlations.
Model Training and Validation: Use machine learning algorithms to predict crime types and locations.
Model Evaluation: Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Crime Prediction: Forecast future crime events based on historical data.
Data Sources
Chicago Crime Data: Chicago Crime Data Portal
Los Angeles Crime Data: Los Angeles Open Data Portal
The datasets contain information on crime types, locations (latitude and longitude), and the date/time of occurrences.

Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and tested:

K-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN): A non-parametric method for classification based on proximity.
Decision Trees: A tree-like model that makes decisions based on feature splits.
Random Forest: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted crime occurrences.
Precision: Proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified by the model.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
